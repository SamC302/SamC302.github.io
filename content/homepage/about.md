Hi! My name is Kandasamy Chokkalingam. I'm currently a MSCS student at CMU, and I previously got my B.S. in CS and a B.S. in Applied Math from UMD. I'm interested in software development, Linux, and programming languages.

In my free time, I enjoy biking and listening to good music. I happen to spend a lot of timing customizing my setup, breaking things and then finding ways to fix them. Recently, I've also picked up woodworking, and I've made a few bowls and spoons!
