Hi! My name is Kandasamy Chokkalingam. I'm currently at UMD doing a Bachelor's of Science in CS and another in Applied Math. I'm interested in software development, Linux, and cybersecurity.

In my free time, I enjoy biking and listening to good music. I happen to spend a lot of timing customizing my setup, breaking things and then finding ways to fix them.
