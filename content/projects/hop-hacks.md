## Summary

- Collaborated with a 3 member team to create a energy usage and impact comparison tool in 36 hours
- Created and developed a ReactJS web app along with testing and developing a Flask backend

## Background

I participated in the HopHacks Hackathon with two other people and we decided to make a web app to estimate users' energy consumption and compare it to global trends.

## Implementation

We used React to develop the web app and various libraries including React-Router to add other functionality. We then deployed it to AWS EC2 using a Flask server.
