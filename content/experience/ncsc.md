## Summary

- Solved various cybersecurity, web, binary, and cryptography problems using Python, Javascript and Linux
- Learned about various cybersecurity techniques and topics

## Cyberstart

This was the initial part of the competition. It was a simple CTF-esque platform with a very long running time. I solved a majority of these problems and learned a bit from the challenges they gave. One of the things I really appreciated about this platform was the provided Field Manual. It was a great source of information and I still have notes from it.

## NCS CTF

If you qualified by completing enough of Cyberstart, or through other competitions, you were invited to NCS CTF. I enjoyed competing in this CTF as well! The challenges were unique and required a fair amount of problem solving to crack. They increased in a pretty linear order and I was able to solve quite a few of them with tricks I knew beforehand and others I learned while competing. I placed high enough to become a National Cyber Scholar.
