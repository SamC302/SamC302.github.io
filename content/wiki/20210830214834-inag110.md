## Textbook Notes {#textbook-notes}


### Chapter 1 {#chapter-1}


#### Communication Defined {#communication-defined}

-   Communication is the process of creating meaning through symbolic interaction.
    -   The symbols in communication are arbitrary and can be anything.
    -   Communication is a continuous process and depends on past context.
        -   Context and previous communication form the basis for communication in the present.
    -   Once something is said, it can't be unsaid.
    -   Communication requires more than one person to make any sense.
        -   Similarly, communication changes depending on who is communicating.


#### Models of Communication {#models-of-communication}

-   Linear Model
    -   People takes turns being a sender and a receiver.
    -   A sender encodes a message and a receiver decodes them.
    -   The sender and receiver communication through some medium called a channel.
    -   In both of their environments, their surroundings and their noise affects their respective encoding and decoding.
    -   Noise is any force that interferes with effective communication
        -   External - Factors outside of a person
        -   Physiological - Biological factors of a person (physical feelings)
        -   Psychological - Mental factors of a person (feelings, perception)
    -   Their environment includes their physical location and their experiences.
    -   The larger the shared environment, the easier it is to communication effectively.
-   Transactional Model
    -   Since communication is a process, the linear model misses the continuous part of it.
    -   You can be both a sender and a receiver simultaneously.
    -   In a transactional model, sender and receivers both become communicators.
    -   Both communicators listen for feedback - a receiver's response to a sender's message.
    -   The transactional model also includes non-purposeful messages, something that isn't explicitly communicated, so both communicators decode and **respond**


#### Communication Contexts {#communication-contexts}

-   Intrapersonal
    -   This is talking to yourself (inner voice)
    -   This is always prevalent and affects your view of yourself

    -   It's a lot of most interactions
-   Small Group Communication
    -   This is a group people interacting with each other
    -   A group presents a majority (a large group that conveys certain messages - explicit or not) which can create pressure

    -   They can also be more creative
-   Organizational Communication
    -   This is a small group with a goal (an organization)
    -   Each organization has its own culture and all do things to achieve a certain goal
    -   This culture evolves with the organization
-   Public Communication
    -   This is a large group (some people cannot contribute)
    -   Only some people are in control of the interactions and communication the most
    -   This also presents opportunities for planning and structure
-   Mass Communication
    -   Messages beamed to massive amounts of people
    -   This is much less tailored and personal

    -   Many of these are created with Organizational Communication
    -   These are also gatekept by people who control their situation and sending


#### The Unique Context of Social Media {#the-unique-context-of-social-media}

-   Social media means audience size changes wildly
