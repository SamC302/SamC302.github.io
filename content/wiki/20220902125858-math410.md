A subset \\(S\\) of \\(\R\\) is **dense** if and only if \\(\forall a,b \in \R, a \lt b, \exists x \in S \ni a \lt x \lt b\\)

Theorem 1. \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) is a dense subset of \\(\R\\)

\\(a \lt \frac{m}{n} \lt b\\)

\\(na \lt m \lt nb\\)

\\(nb-na \gt 1 \Rightarrow a-b \gt \frac{1}{n}\\)

By a thm, \\(\exists m \in \Z \ni nb-1 \le m \lt nb\\)

Let a &lt; b be two reals since b-a &gt; 0 by AP &exist; n &isin; \N &ni; 1\m &lt; b-a implies 1 &lt; nb - na &rArr; na &gt; nb-1

For irrational proof, use addition

Let \\(\epsilon\\) be positive
By AP there is a natural number N st. \\(1/N \lt \epsilon\\)
If \\(n \ge N\\) then \\(\abs{1\n - 0} = 1\n \le 1\N \le epislon\\)

Basic strucut - epislon positive, ap shows some big N less than episolon number exists, If n &ge; N, then start with abs and redo the simplicifaction to show all steps anre great than before, and finallyit's less than epislon

diverge - AP to show there is some number for which the function is always positive and therefore, there is always a number greater

Let M &gt; 0, By AP &exist; n &isin; Naturals such that N &gt; max (4,M)
If n &gt;gt N then n^2 03n = n(n-3) &gt; n(4-3) &ge; N &gt; M
this limit goes to infinity
