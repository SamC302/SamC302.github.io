## CMSC131 Review {#cmsc131-review}


### Data Privacy {#data-privacy}

-   Data should be as private as possible
-   Instead of getters and setters, write methods that use the class's data in the class itself


### Object Copying {#object-copying}


#### Reference Copy {#reference-copy}

-   Simply copy reference, same object
-   fast, but not a real copy


#### Shallow Copy {#shallow-copy}

-   Copy the object, but not any objects it refers to
-   middling, and a somewhat decent copy


#### Deep Copy {#deep-copy}

-   Copy the object and everything it ever refers to
-   Slow, but deep


### Initialization {#initialization}


#### Initialization Blocks {#initialization-blocks}

-   Block of code in a class but not in a method used to initialize static or nonstatic fields of the class
-   Can contain complex initialization including loops
-   Executed once per object


#### Static Initialization Blocks {#static-initialization-blocks}

-   Block of code in a class but not in a method used to initialize static or nonstatic fields of the class
-   Can contain complex initialization including loops
-   Executed once per ckass


### Enumerated Types {#enumerated-types}

-   Fixed set of values
-   Have the methods `values()`, `valueOf()`, and `compareTo()`


#### `Comparable` Interface {#comparable-interface}

-   Requires the `compareTo()` method
-   Returns a value that represents their comparison
    -   `A.compareTo(B) < 0` if A<B
    -   `A.compareTo(B) = 0` if A=B
    -   `A.compareTo(B) > 0` if A>B
-   Imposes a natural ordering


## Inheritance {#inheritance}

-   A subclass (child class) can _inherit_ fields and methods from a superclass (parent class) while still having its own unique fields and methods
-   Java only permits single inheritance
-   All classes inherit from `Object` in Java
-   If a subclass's constructor does not call some form of `super()`, a call to `super()` with no parameters will be made even if no such constructor exists


### Polymorphism {#polymorphism}

-   A subclass can be stored with a super class reference because a subclass _is a_ superclass
-   This can be as deep as wanted


### Testing types of objects {#testing-types-of-objects}

-   `ref instanceof class` will check if `ref` is a `class` or any of its children classes
-   `ref.getClass() =` class.getClass()= will check if `ref` is `class` only
-   `instanceof` will be fine if `ref` is null, but `getClass` will not
-   Avoid these, and use [Overriding](#overriding)


### Visibility {#visibility}

-   From a superclass reference, only fields and methods visible from that superclass can be accessed even if the object is a subclass


### Casting {#casting}

-   Downcasting is valid only when the actual object is of that type, otherwise you get a `ClassCastException`
-   Upcasting is always valid as long as the type is valid in the hierarchy
-   Type never changes, just how it's treated


### Overriding {#overriding}

-   [Testing types of objects](#testing-types-of-objects) and then [Casting](#casting) is bad style, instead you should override methods and fields to have different behavior
-   Overriding methods have the same name and signature (other than access modifiers) of a superclass method
-   The type of the object (not reference) at runtime determines which method will run
    -   This is called `dynamic dispatch`


### Privacy {#privacy}

-   Subclass can only be more or as restrictive on override fields or methods than its parent class
-   `protected` allows only subclasses to access the thing


### `super` {#super}

-   subclasses can use `super.method()` to call the superclass version of an override method
-   They can do the same with fields, although its confusing because it shadows the superclass field
-   If x doesn't exist in `super.x` or `super.x()`, a syntax error will be raised


### Deep Inheritance {#deep-inheritance}

-   Class inherit from the closest place where defined above


### `final` {#final}

-   Cannot be overridden
-   private methods are therefore final
-   A `final` class can't be extended or its methods overridden
-   Helps with security


### `Object` {#object}

-   Everything inherits from here
-   Therefore, every object is guaranteed to have these methods


## Interfaces {#interfaces}

-   These are contracts of constants and methods to define
    -   Can technically have default and static methods as of Java 8
-   Classes can implement interfaces (and multiple of them)
-   As such, classes that implement an interface can be stored in that a reference of that interface's type


## OOP Design {#oop-design}

-   Nouns -> Class, Verbs -> Methods, Adjectives -> Interfaces
-   Too many classes can mean more complexity, but too little can mean not enough flexibility or abstraction
-   **subtype**: either a subclass of a type or implements that type
-   Inheritance is nice, but sometimes we want composition (_has a_ relationship)
    -   Go for composition first, if not inheritance
    -   inheritance is more restrictive (only one subtype per parent type)
-   Types of Inheritance
    -   Extension: Add new functionality
    -   Limitation: Restrict behavior to a certain subset
    -   Combination: Mix multiple classes and their behaviors


## Abstract Classes {#abstract-classes}

-   Fix the solution of having useless parent classes that only serve to group together child calsses
-   If a method is designated as abstract, then children classes must implement it
    -   If a method is abstract, its class must also be abstract
-   Abstract classes can't be instatiated, but can be a reference


## Errors {#errors}

-   Errors cause program incorrectness


### Compile Errors {#compile-errors}

-   Errors in what you type (or say)


### Runtime Errors {#runtime-errors}

-   Something that's impossible or illegal to execute


### Logic Errors {#logic-errors}

-   Errors in what you mean
-   The algorithm itself it flawed


### Testing {#testing}

-   We can run specific, pre-computed cases to check our results


#### Code Coverage {#code-coverage}

-   How much code was tested?
-   Line/Statement Coverage: what percentage of lines/statements were run?
-   Branch Coverage: what percentage of conditions were tested (case-by-case basis)?
-   Path Coverage: what percentage of all possible execution sequences were tested?


### Error Handling {#error-handling}

-   We have to handle an error somehow instead of just dying, right?
-   We can tell the caller by returning an error code


#### Exceptions {#exceptions}

-   However, error codes can make things complex in terms of return types
-   In this case, we `throw` an `Exception`
-   In Java, `Exceptions` are objects that extend `Throwable`


#### Checked Exceptions {#checked-exceptions}

-   These must be handled because they're fairly easy to deal with and fairly common
-   `Exception`


#### Unchecked Exceptions {#unchecked-exceptions}

-   These are more serious and aren't easy to recover from, and don't need to be caught
-   Automatically caught by the JVM
-   `RuntimeException` and `Error`


#### `throw` {#throw}

-   Generates an exception of the given type


#### `throws` {#throws}

-   This propagates the exception to the method's caller
-   Put in the method signature and details what exception it is throwing


#### Try/Catch Blocks {#try-catch-blocks}

-   Methods can handle an exception themselves
-   Order of execution:
    -   Leave try block and go to first match catching block
    -   Execute catch block
    -   Execute finally
        -   If nothing matched, go to caller

<!--list-separator-->

-  `finally`

    -   Always executes, no matter what
    -   Even if no catch block matches and control goes to caller, finally still executes


## Generics {#generics}

-   Removes a concrete type from the code, and replaces it with some stand in type variable


### Type Parameters {#type-parameters}

-   In Java, use `<T>` to specify a type parameter


### Generic Classes {#generic-classes}

-   Put a [Type Parameter](#type-parameters) next to the class
-   When instantiation, provide a concrete class as an argument for the type parameter


### Generic Methods {#generic-methods}

-   For methods, simply use the [Type Parameter](#type-parameters) inplace of a regular type
-   You should use these when the return type or other variable depend on a method specific type


### Generic Variables {#generic-variables}

-   Simply use the [Type Parameter](#type-parameters) inplace of a regular type


### Bounded Type Parameters {#bounded-type-parameters}

-   You can use the `extends` keyword to limit the type to be a subtype of a given type
-   You can use the `super` keyword to limit the type to be a supertype of a given type
-   You will be able to call methods that are visible from the given type due to inheritance


### Wildcard Type Parameters {#wildcard-type-parameters}

-   Issue: `Generic<S>` is not a subclass of `Generic<T>` even if `S` is a subclass of `T`
-   `?` stands for any type
-   You can combine this with [Bounded Type Parameters](#bounded-type-parameters) to limit to a subclass


### Quirks of Generics {#quirks-of-generics}

-   Can't instantiate an object of the generic type
-   Must use `T[] data = (T[]) new Object[size];` to create array (cast `Object` array to type `T[]`)


### Type Erasure {#type-erasure}

-   Make nothing type-specific and do a ton of casting implicitly


## Inner Classes {#inner-classes}

-   We want access to a class's fields for one other class but its bad to make it public
-   Inner Class: A class defined inside another that can access all fields and methods despite access modifies (and vice-versa)
-   Inner class has a link to its outer class object
-   Static Inner class has no link to its outer class object


## Lists {#lists}

-   Sequential group of elements with a one-to-one relation
-   The head is the first one in the list, the tail is the last


### Linked List {#linked-list}

-   A list has nodes which store data and a reference to the next node
-   Insertion
    -   Create a new element, set it's `next` to `current`'s `next`, and then set `current`'s next to itself.
-   Deletion
    -   Set `prev`'s `next` to `current`'s next.
-   Linked lists are nice but try not to iterate through too often (i.e. getting the size)
-   Variations
    -   Dummy head node
        -   Simplifies special cases by having a permanent head node that doesn't change
    -   Circularly Linked Lists
        -   List loops around
    -   Doubly-Linked Lists
        -   Node links backward
        -   Must update references in both prev and next
    -   Tail Reference
        -   We store a reference to the tail to avoid travel all the way down


### Arrays Vs. Linked Lists {#arrays-vs-dot-linked-lists}

-   Linked Lists have easy insertion and deletion any where
-   Arrays can do easy indexing and less memory
-   Linked lists can't really index easily and take more memory
-   Arrays need a lot of reshaping and moving for common operations


## `equals` {#equals}

-   Must do 5 things
    1.  Take a parameter of type `Object`
    2.  Check if parameter is not null
    3.  Check if parameter is an object of the class
    4.  Cast parameter to object of the class
    5.  Compare fielss
    6.  Bonus: if subclass call super.equals()


## Recursion {#recursion}

-   Solve a problem with a method that repeatedly calls itself
-   Every method gets its own space on the runtime stack
-   Every iterative method can be done with recursion
-   To do it well:
    -   Check the base case works properly
    -   Break the problem into repeated steps
    -   Make sure to merge them
-   Auxiliary methods are often needed to pass other parameters or helper variables


### Tail Recursion {#tail-recursion}

-   Recursive step is the last performed
-   Very easy to transform it into a loop


### Recursion Vs. Iteration {#recursion-vs-dot-iteration}

-   Iteration is often more efficient
-   Recursion has a higher overhead but can be much easier to write, maintain and debug, and work well with certain data structres


## Polymorphic Lists {#polymorphic-lists}

-   A list is made of multiple `List` objects that store a reference to another `List` objects where `List` is an interface and the concrete classes are `EmptyList` or `NonEmptyList`
-   Uses overriding and interfacing to avoid checking for null and dealing with the end of lists


## Iterators {#iterators}

-   Classes that can be iterated over must implement `Iterable<T>`
-   `Iterable<T>` specifies one method `iterator()` that returns an `Iterator<T>`
-   `Iterator<T>` itself is a interface that specific a few methods
-   Make it an inner class for ease of access
-   for-each loops automatically handle iterator
    -   Just give it something iterable
