## Basic C Syntax {#basic-c-syntax}


### Preprocessor Directives {#preprocessor-directives}

Code at the beginning of a file that starts with a #. This is run before compilation.

{{< code language="c" line-numbers="&quot;true&quot;" title="Preprocessor Directives" isCollapsed="true" >}}
\#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
\#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
\#include &lt;string.h&gt;
\#define MAX_COLS 20 _\* max # of columns to process \*_
\#define MAX_INPUT 1000
{{< /code >}}

`#define` defines a constant value, `#include` includes another file's declarations.


### Main Function {#main-function}

-   Returns an int, takes no arguments (so void)

{{< code language="c" line-numbers="&quot;true&quot;" title="Main Function" isCollapsed="true" >}}
int main(void){
    _\* Some code \*_
    return 0;
}
{{< /code >}}


## Basic Concepts {#basic-concepts}


### Environments {#environments}


#### Translation Environment {#translation-environment}

-   Source code get compiled into object code which then gets linked with other object code by the linker to form a single executable


#### Execution Environment {#execution-environment}

-   The code is then excuted by loading it into memory (an os is not neccessary but usually used), setting it up, running it, and terminating it by returning [main's](#main-function) error code.


### Lexical Rules {#lexical-rules}


#### Trigraphs {#trigraphs}

-   A 3-sequence of a characters that may not be easily typeable


#### Comments {#comments}

-   Begin with `/*` and end with `*/`
-   Can be multiple lines, by not nested
    -   If they're multiple lines, they get everything on those lines


## Data {#data}


### Integers {#integers}


#### Values {#values}

`short` &lt;= `int` &lt;= `long`

| Type               | Signedness | Max Start  | Min End    |
|--------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| int                | signed     | -32767     | 32767      |
| unsigned int       | unsigned   | 0          | 65535      |
| short int          | unsigned   | -32767     | 32767      |
| unsigned short int | signed     | 0          | 65535      |
| long int           | signed     | -214783647 | 2147483647 |
| unsigned long int  | unsigned   | 0          | 4294967295 |
| char               | NA         | 0          | 127        |
| signed char        | signed     | -127       | 127        |
| unsigned char      | unsigned   | 0          | 255        |


#### Literals {#literals}

-   Decimals
-   In octal when starting with a 0
-   In hex when starting with an 0x
-   Characters literals in single quotes


### Enumerated Type {#enumerated-type}


#### Values {#values}

-   Enums are stored as ints
-   The numbers after the name are optional

{{< code language="c" >}}
enum Jar_Type { CUP=8, PINT=16, QUART=32, HALF_GALLON=64, GALLON=128 };
{{< /code >}}


### Floating-Point {#floating-point}

-   Have a decimal point `3.141`
-   Have an exponent `1E10`
-   Or both `6.023e23`


### Pointers {#pointers}

-   Every memory location has an address
-   **Pointer** is another name for address
-   **Pointer Variable** is a variable whose value is an address of a moeory location
-   There are no point constants because we can't predict where memory addresses will be
-   To declare a pointer, use the indirection operator before the variable
    -   The indirection operation gets the value at an address, so therefore the variable stores a pointer to an address with a value of the given type
    -   `int *a` is an in pointer
    -   If you declare multiple on the same line, you need a `*` for each one
    -   When initializing it on the same line, the value you give goes to the variable itself, not the pointer


### String Literals {#string-literals}

-   C has no string type, but there is a string literal
-   A string is a sequence of characters terminated by a `NUL` byte
    -   A sequence of zero characters is valid


### Declaring Arrays {#declaring-arrays}

-   Like declaring an int, but with square brackets after the name with a capacity value: `int values[20]`


### `Typedef` {#typedef}


## Scope {#scope}
