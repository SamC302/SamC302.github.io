This page serves as an entry point to the rest of my Wiki. I use this to store and access notes I take on various topics, classes or readings.

Everything below this point is automatically exported straight from the notes on my computer. I'm using org-roam in Emacs to make them, and ox-hugo to export them. If you'd like more info on how this is organized, check out [Organizational System](organizational-system)
