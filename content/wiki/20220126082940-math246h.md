## Definitions and Terminology of Differential Equations {#definitions-and-terminology-of-differential-equations}


### Definition of DEs {#definition-of-des}

Some combination of one or more unknown functions with respect to one or more independent variable and those variables


### Ordinary DEs {#ordinary-des}

A DE where there is only one unknown variable. A DE that is not ordinary is a partial DE


### Order of DEs {#order-of-des}

The highest derivative that appears in the DE.


### Linearity {#linearity}

A DE is linear if there is no function composition on the unknown functions or their derivatives.


### Systems of DEs {#systems-of-des}

-   It is a system of ODEs if there is only one unknown variable. A system that does not satisfy this is a system of PDEs.
-   The order of a system is the highest order of all of its equations.
-   A system is linear if every equation in it is linear.
