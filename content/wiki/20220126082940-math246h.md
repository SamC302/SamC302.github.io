## Definitions and Terminology of Differential Equations {#definitions-and-terminology-of-differential-equations}


### Definition of DEs {#definition-of-des}

Some combination of one or more unknown functions with respect to one or more independent variable and those variables


### Ordinary DEs {#ordinary-des}

A DE where there is only one unknown variable. A DE that is not ordinary is a partial DE


### Order of DEs {#order-of-des}

The highest derivative that appears in the DE.


### Linearity {#linearity}

A DE is linear if there is no function composition on the unknown functions or their derivatives.


### Systems of DEs {#systems-of-des}

-   It is a system of ODEs if there is only one unknown variable. A system that does not satisfy this is a system of PDEs.
-   The order of a system is the highest order of all of its equations.
-   A system is linear if every equation in it is linear.


## Linear Equations {#linear-equations}

-   DEs that are [linear](#linearity)


### Linear Normal Form {#linear-normal-form}

\\[\frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{q(t)}{p(t)}y = \frac{r(t)}{p(t)}\\]
From now on, \\(a(t) = \frac{q(t)}{p(t)}\\) and \\(f(t) = \frac{r(t)}{p(t)}\\)


#### Homogeneous {#homogeneous}

\\[\frac{dy}{dt} + a(t)y = 0\\]
By analyzing the equation, we see that this means that \\(y\\) is equal to its derivative. We know that \\(e^x\\) operates as such and we can conclude that the general solution to a Homogeneous Linear DE is:
\\[y = Ce^{-A(t)}\\]
where \\(A(t) = \int a(t)dt\\).


#### Inhomogeneous {#inhomogeneous}

\\[\frac{dy}{dt} + a(t)y = f(t)\\]
This isn't quite as nice as the [homogeneous](#homogeneous) version, but we can still solve it.

-  Integrating Factor

    Multiply both sides by \\(e^{A(t)}\\).
    \\[e^{A(t)}\frac{dy}{dt} + a(t)e^{A(t)}y = e^{A(t)}f(t)\\]
    The left side is the derivative of \\(e^{A(t)}y\\)
    \\[\frac{d}{dt}(e^{A(t)}y) = e^{A(t)}f(t)\\]
    This is integrating factor form. Now we can integrate both sides and solve for \\(y\\) to get the solution.

-  General Solution

    \\[y = e^{-A(t)}\int A(t)f(t)dt + Ce^{-A(t)}\\]


## Separable Equations {#separable-equations}

Equations that can be written in the form:
\\[\frac{dy}{dt} = g(y)f(t)\\]
We simply multiply both sides by \\(dt\\) and divide by \\(g(y)\\) and integrate both sides to solve. The general solution is:
\\[\int \frac{1}{g(y)}dy = \int f(t)dt\\]
Assuming both of these integrals are computable,
\\[G(y) = F(t) + C\\]
Assuming that \\(G(y)\\) has an inverse, \\(G^{-1}(y)\\),
\\[y = G^{-1}(F(t) + C)\\]
