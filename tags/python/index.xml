&lt;li>Designing and engineering a solution to ingest and analyze robotics data from many sources in real-time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Constructed and deployed a Python backend with Pandas and Numpy to AWS EC2&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developed a REST API to interface a web app with a MySQL database hosted with AWS&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Built a web app interface using Flask and Bulma to view and interact with analyzed data&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In high school, I participated in the &lt;a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition&lt;/a> (FRC). The competition consists of multiple matches where two alliances of 3 robots, each from different teams, compete. We wanted to collect data on each alliance&amp;rsquo;s and &lt;span class="sidenote">
&lt;label class="sidenote-label" for="each-teams">each team&amp;#39;s&lt;/label>
&lt;input class="sidenote-checkbox" type="checkbox" id="each-teams">&lt;/input>
&lt;span class="sidenote-content">
While an alliance loses or wins together, alliances are random and vary, so we want to focus on team specific information.
&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>
performance to come up with a better strategy for each match.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our goal was to design a tool to take data collected from our team members scouting matches and from &lt;a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com">The Blue Alliance&lt;/a>, a data source that collection data per match, and validate, store, and perform calculations on it. We wanted to leave analysis to members while still performing calculations of certain metrics to provide other insights.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="implementation">Implementation&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="backend">Backend&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The backend consists of a python application that is responsible for ingesting the data from multiple sources, validating data from one source against another, calculating common metrics and other performance metrics, and storing it in a external MySQL database. Numpy and Pandas were used to perform calculations and operations on the data and SQLAlchemy (specifically their ORM interface) was used to store and access data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For competitions, the backend is deployed to an AWS EC2 instance, and the database is hosted on AWS RDS.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="frontend">Frontend&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In addition to the backend for data processing, a frontend was built to more easily input data, view data, and manage settings and configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, scouts input data into a google form, and data was ingested from the connected sheet. However, we ran into issues with certain form fields not being efficient enough to input to. For example, tallying game pieces scored had to either be manually re-entered or the scout would have to hit small buttons. To fix this, I implemented our own form to improve the scouts' experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To properly serve the frontend, an API was constructed with Flask and interfaces with the external database. The frontend also includes the capability to view data so that members can quickly look up statistics or other data points to build an effective strategy. Members can also adjust settings directly from the frontend interface as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Over the summer of 2020, I interned under Dr. William Gasarch at the University of Maryland. Despite being a high school student, I worked with others in the REU-CAAR program on combinatorics and machine learning. I focused on Ramsey numbers and games and applying various forms of machine learning to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ramsey numbers describe the minimum size of a graph in which it cannot have a clique of a certain size where the edges are all the same color. We know the first few Ramsey numbers, but they grow in complexity very rapidly. Proofs can be convoluted and complex, but would it be possible to train machine learning models to prove them for us? Ramsey games involve two agents who color edges on a graph in turns to create a clique of a certain size. If a clique can be created, then the graph&amp;rsquo;s size is not a Ramsey number for the given clique size. Therefore, if we train machine learning models to play these games and have them play them on different graphs, we may be able to rule out certain Ramsey numbers. I focused on the first step: is it possible to train machine learning models to play these games and which type is the most efficient?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using pytorch in python, I created 4 different types of models: Monte Carlo Tree Search, Tabular Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning, and Graph Neural Networks. Using networkx, I developed an implementation of Ramsey games and trained these models to play Ramsey games. I evaluated their performance on multiple metrics: the number of moves, win rate, mean time taken to make a move, memory used, average loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After performing the tests, I analyzed the results. Using XeTeX, I wrote a paper describing my research, methods, results, and conclusions. I created plots and figures using matplotlib. I also created a presentation and poster, both in LaTeX, using Beamer. This was my first project using LaTeX and I really enjoyed it. Despite a bit of a steep learning curve and setup, it produced professional and clean looking results and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about formatting as much. I presented the presentation to my school in January of 2021, and my poster at ScienceMontgomery, where I was awarded an Honorable Mention in the CS category.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was a part of my high school&amp;rsquo;s FIRST Robotics Competition team for all 4 years in high school. I loved participating and was on leadership for 3 years working to make the team better. In addition, I drove the robot during competitions for 2 years. I participated in a variety of ways and learned so much from other people, projects, and the competition in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="activites">Activites&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="mechanical-engineering-and-design">Mechanical Engineering and Design&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In my freshman year I helped produce and manufacture parts for the robot. I used various shop tools to measure, cut, and assemble parts made of wood, metal, and polycarbonate. In my sophomore year, I helped to design a robot from scratch using Onshape, which is professional CAD software. Along with other members, I designed an accurate representation of our robot in CAD and iterated on the design as needed. To aid assembly, we produced drawings from CAD using the software, along with using CAM software to generate instructions for our CNC mill.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="software-development">Software Development&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In my senior year, I joined the programming subteam. That year, we switched to a holonomic drivebase, and, along with other members, we developed software to properly control it using an game controller. I also worked on a &lt;a href="https://www.kandasamyc.me/projects/scouting-data-ingest">project&lt;/a> to aid scouts during competition.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="development-of-outreach-programs">Development of Outreach Programs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I also led the development of three different outreach programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One program was targeted at local girl scout troops. Based on badge requirements, I developed a curriculum to help them get badges for robotics at different levels. I based the curriculum off othe VEX Robotics Competition parts we had and led camp sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another program was a week-long robotics summer camp. I helped to design the curriculum for these camps for two summers. For both summers, I put in 40-hour weeks counseling and leading these camps by managing campers and counselors, counseling campers, and making sure things ran smoothly, along with coaching other counselors before hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final program was a result of the robotics summer camp. I volunteered to help mentor a group of middle school campers who wanted to establish their own VEX Robotics Competition team. For two seasons, I taught them about various aspects of robotics, helped them build their own robot, and mentored them at competitions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3d-modeling">3D Modeling&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Another project I worked on was creating renders of the CAD model of our robot. I exported the CAD model into Blender, and spent time learning how to create realistic renders of the robot. I&amp;rsquo;ve included a few of my favorite renders below.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="implementation">Implementation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I had just learned about &lt;a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich">Rich&lt;/a> and wanted to &lt;span class="sidenote">
&lt;label class="sidenote-label" for="try-it-out">try it out&lt;/label>
&lt;input class="sidenote-checkbox" type="checkbox" id="try-it-out">&lt;/input>
&lt;span class="sidenote-content">
Rich is amazing to use. If you haven't tried it out, I recommend you do!
&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>
so I used that to make the CLI. I used the StudentVue library to get grade data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main functionality I wanted to implement was modifying the grades of current assignment and being able to add future assignments and see what my grade would be. It was fairly easy to do us and thanks to Rich&amp;rsquo;s color support, I was able to make using it clear.&lt;/p>
