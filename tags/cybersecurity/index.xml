&lt;p>This was the initial part of the competition. It was a simple CTF-esque platform with a very long running time. I solved a majority of these problems and learned a bit from the challenges they gave. One of the things I really appreciated about this platform was the provided Field Manual. It was a great source of information and I still have notes from it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ncs-ctf">NCS CTF&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you qualified by completing enough of Cyberstart, or through other competitions, you were invited to NCS CTF. I enjoyed competing in this CTF as well! The challenges were unique and required a fair amount of problem solving to crack. They increased in a pretty linear order and I was able to solve quite a few of them with tricks I knew beforehand and others I learned while competing. I placed high enough to become a National Cyber Scholar.&lt;/p>
