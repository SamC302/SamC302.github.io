The idea that a computer, a distinctly non-human entity, could act, think, and sound like we do has gripped society almost ever since it was first theorized in 1955. The field has grown exponentially, with steady progress over the decades culminating in a revolution today.</p><p>Over the past year, we&rsquo;ve seen the release of models that can write and create images like never before: DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, and a new version of GPT-3. These models have drastically changed the field&rsquo;s landscape, both in terms of technology and accessibility. The new models generate text and images so realistic, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to tell the difference from a human creation. Their release has also placed their power directly into the hands of the public, with all of them seeing broad access for beta-testing and commercial purposes. They&rsquo;ve given people the ability to generate nearly any image or passage they could imagine with a single sentence. Put simply, 2022 has seen AI like never before.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not entirely a good thing. Society as a whole has wrestled with the concept that AI would eventually attain human levels of quality in various fields for a long time, but up until now, it&rsquo;s always been just out of reach. In 2022, we ran out of time. In 2022, the advent of AI has made the world muddier. We&rsquo;ve faced the realization that there are AIs as good and sometimes, even better than us at fields we thought only we could do. An AI won an art competition and sparked a ban to prevent it from being used again(Metz, Rachel, 2022), and forums have had to ban them because they&rsquo;ve flooded answers with almost correct but wrong answers (Vincent, James, 2022). There are many not unfounded fears that AI is coming for us, for our jobs, for our hobbies, for everything (Morris, Andrea). But this isn&rsquo;t the case. There have been a variety of counter-arguments, but I&rsquo;d like to focus on three of the most important: credibility, bias, and AI as an abstraction of us.</p><ol class=org-ol><li>In terms of credibility, AI has gotten good at understanding the semantics of text. Asking GPT-3 a question will get you an answer just as easily as googling the information and most of the time, with higher quality. But <i>most</i> is exactly where the troubles lie. How knowledgeable are today&rsquo;s AI? How do we trust they&rsquo;re right? Can we?</li><li>Furthermore, with just how often they&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s easy to forget that AI isn&rsquo;t infallible. In particular, a model is only as good as its data. That is, if the data is wrong, the model will be wrong. This seems like mostly a non-issue, but the trouble again lies in the details. It&rsquo;s easy to tell if a model is outright wrong but harder to tell if a model is slightly biased. Are today&rsquo;s models biased? If so, how much are they biased? In fact, can we even make them unbiased?</li><li>Finally, up until now, all of our discoveries, inventions, art, and writing have been the result of a human effort. They&rsquo;ve been directly influenced by their creator&rsquo;s environment and context. But AI creates based on the aggregation of data without context. The knowledge that an AI has is an abstraction of ours. Thus, can it create the same as us? Do we value its products the same way?</li></ol><p>To this end, I&rsquo;ve used these models to generate content related to the course in four specific topics: Johann Storch and the four humors, human difference, Samuel Morton, and recipe reconstruction. In this article, I&rsquo;ll demonstrate the capabilities of these models through these topics, analyze their products in the context of our course to draw conclusions on credibility, bias, and abstraction, and conclude by discussing the implications this advent of AI has on us.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-org1033832 class=outline-2><h2 id=org1033832><span class=section-number-2>2.</span> All Things AI: A Crash Course<a href=#org1033832 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><div class=outline-text-2 id=text-2><p>Before we get into any analysis of AI itself, it&rsquo;s important to understand how we got here and, at a high level, how AI works.</p><p>The term &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; itself comes from a proposal published in 1955, but the foundational concepts go back even further. In 1863, Samuel Butler discussed how machine and man might coexist as living organisms (Willey, Basil, 2022) and in 1921, Karel Čapek created a play that introduced the word robot (&ldquo;factory-made artificial people&rdquo;) into the English lexicon ({ai.nl}, 2021). 1950 saw the invention of the iconic Turing test that determines whether a machine really can think like a human and 1968 brought AI into the mainstream with the release of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. In 1986, the first driverless car was finished and in 1995, A.L.I.C.E, the first chatbot trained on the web, came into existence. ImageNet, an object recognition model, was released in 2007 and revolutionized the field. In the 2010s, AI came to the consumer, with IBM&rsquo;s Watson competing on Jeopardy and Apple&rsquo;s Siri hitting iPhones everywhere. In 2016, Google&rsquo;s AlphaGo beat the then-world champion Lee Sedol at his own game. In 2020, OpenAI released GPT-3, a language model like the world had never seen, and followed up on it by adapting it into DALL-E in 2022, an image generation model that was equally as groundbreaking.</p><p>From this history, we can see that it&rsquo;s taken a long time and a lot of advancements to get where we are today. AI research has been painfully slow at times, but it&rsquo;s only because of all those technological advancements can the models we know today work so well({ai.nl}, 2021). Each model has built on the ones before it, with new architectures coming into existence over time. It&rsquo;s important to understand this because it allows us to realistically analyze the models themselves, by understanding what they can and can&rsquo;t do. To take this further lets briefly go over how AI models generally work today and then dive into some specifics of the models we&rsquo;ll be talking about.</p><p>At its core, the idea behind AI is fairly simple. We start with a model: a model, given some data, produces some output. That&rsquo;s it. To make the model &ldquo;learn&rdquo;, we have to train it to produce the output we want. We give the model some input that we know what should be output, and then reward the model based on how good its output is({IBM}, 2021). The reward incentives the model to continue to do the same sort of process that produced a good output. Most models do this using neural networks. A neural network models how neurons work in the human brain. A network consists of multiple layers of nodes. Nodes in a layer are connected to nodes in the next layer. Each node has an activation level from 0 to 1. A node passes its activation level through its connections, with each connection having a weight that gets multiplied by the activation level and a bias that gets added to the result. With enough of these nodes and connections, the model can learn incredibly complex data and semantics. Their &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; is stored in this configuration of weights and biases.</p><p>While this is the core idea, the models we&rsquo;ll be looking at have used many other advanced techniques. These include text autoencoding, diffusion, and conversions to latent spaces(Alammar, Jay, ). In short, text autoencoding converts language into a collection of words and allows a model to get at the semantic meaning underneath. Diffusion is a relatively new technique that allows image-based models to make gradual improvements to the details of generated images. Latent spaces allow for the denser representation and storing of knowledge in a way that fits the data better than it makes sense to us. The details are all unfortunately beyond the scope of this article, but it&rsquo;s important to understand that these models aren&rsquo;t just magic. Real science and computation are going on behind the scenes. These models aren&rsquo;t perfect, and they&rsquo;re all limited by their technology.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-org1a80a5a class=outline-2><h2 id=org1a80a5a><span class=section-number-2>3.</span> A New Type of Turing Test<a href=#org1a80a5a class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><div class=outline-text-2 id=text-3><p>Now that we&rsquo;ve discussed how AI works, let&rsquo;s see try and put that information to the test. You may have seen how good these models are already, but I&rsquo;d like to take a moment to drive that point home. We&rsquo;ll do this with a slightly modified version of the Turing test. As mentioned earlier, the Turing test tests machine intelligence by comparing it to a human&rsquo;s({ai.nl}, 2022). In the Turing test, there are 3 players. Players A and B have a conversation through a computer, where one of them is an AI. Player C is the evaluator and watches their conversation happens over text. If Player C can&rsquo;t tell which participant is a machine, then the AI is said to have passed the Turing test.</p><p>To demonstrate what we&rsquo;re working with, I&rsquo;d like to do a similar test in this article as well. I&rsquo;ve prepared 10 text and image samples some of which are from the topics we&rsquo;ll be discussing. Half of these are real, and half of these are generated. Your job will be to decide whether each sample is real or not. Can you tell which is which? I&rsquo;d also like to ask you to think about what your decision criteria are. What are you basing your guesses on? Is it harder or easier than expected?

She is of a delicate constitution, and her health has been failing for some time. She is very pale, and her skin is covered in a fine sheen of sweat. Her eyes are sunken and dark-circled, and her hair is lank and greasy. She suffers from a persistent cough, and her chest is often painful and tight.

f the four humors. In this case, the patient's phlegm is out of balance, causing her to cough and experience chest pain. The feverishness and night sweats are also symptoms of an imbalance in the humors.</p><p>As the 17th century physician, based on the four humors, is the patient of a sanguine, choleric, melancholic, or phlegmatic constitution and why?</p><p>The patient is of a melancholic constitution, which means that she is prone to melancholy and depression. This is likely due to the fact that her health has been failing for some time, and she has lost a great deal of weight.</p><p>As the 17th century physician, based on the four humors, what do you tell this patient of melancholic constitution to do and why?</p><p>There are a few things that the patient can do to improve her condition. First, she should try to improve her diet and eat more nourishing foods. She should also try to get more rest and sleep, as this will help to improve her overall energy levels. Finally, she should try to find ways to distract herself from her negative thoughts and focus on more positive things.</p><h3>Sample 2</h3><p>Suppose a patient presents to you with an excess of
phlegm. Write their case record.</p><p>As a 17th century physician, here is how I might
record a case of a patient with an excess of
phlegm:
Today, I was consulted by a young woman who
complained of feeling unwell and having
difficulty breathing. Upon examination, I found
that her pulse was slow and her skin was pale
and damp. She also had a cough and was producing
a large amount of phlegm. I diagnosed her with
an excess of phlegm in the body, and prescribed
a course of cooling and moistening remedies to
remove the excess humor and restore the balance.
I also recommended that she avoid foods that are
hot and dry, and advised her to eat more cooling
and moistening foods. I will continue to monitor
her condition and provide further treatment as
necessary.</p><h3>Sample 3</h3><p>The patient is a young woman of about 22 years of age. She is of a delicate constitution, and her health has been failing for some time. She is very pale, and her skin is covered in a fine sheen of sweat. Her eyes are sunken and dark-circled, and her hair is lank and greasy. She suffers from a persistent cough, and her chest is often painful and tight. She has a poor appetite and has lost a great deal of weight. She is often feverish, and her nights are restless and disturbed by fits of coughing.</p></div><div class=outline-text-2 id=text-4><p>The first topic I&rsquo;d like to talk about is credibility, through Johann Storch and the Four Humors. On the left, you can see two samples of text, Sample 1 is from GPT-3 and Sample 2 is from ChatGPT. The third sample is a report from Storch himself for comparison (Duden, Barbara, 1991).</p><p>Firstly, it is obvious that these models have a good understanding of both the question and the actual knowledge being asked about itself. In Sample 1, the overall structure of the report is similar to Sample 3. It starts with age and discusses both symptoms and a bit of patient history (&ldquo;been failing for some time&rdquo;, &ldquo;into a violent quarrel and anger&rdquo;). In addition, the model matches the style well. The samples sound like they could have been written by Storch, with appropriate vocabulary and information. The samples mention consumption, constitutions, phlegm, the humors; all things that were relevant in the medical framework of the 17th century ({cabinet}, ). They&rsquo;re not used frivolously either, they&rsquo;re used in a way that makes sense. In Sample 2, I prompted the AI to describe its medical basis just based on the fact it was supposed to pretend to be a 17th-century physician. It provided an accurate response by citing humoralism, explaining about fixing excesses of humors through correcting imbalances, and mentioning changes in diet - all things we&rsquo;ve seen work ({Karen Lyon}, 2015). The model is creating these new hypothetical cases and still providing mostly justifiable diagnoses for all of them. Its information and creations seem mostly credible.</p><p>However, the devil is in the details. While most of its samples here make sense, the AI isn&rsquo;t entirely right. The framework of the four humors is based on balance. If a person goes too far in one direction, they need correction to bring them in the opposite direction. Each person has their neutral point as well, with some already leaning in one direction naturally. But in Sample 2, the AI disregards this idea of counterbalance. It comes up with a case record of someone with too much phlegm, and writes that Storch would &ldquo;prescribe a course of cooling and moistening remedies&rdquo;. Based on what we&rsquo;ve seen, this wouldn&rsquo;t work and would make the problem worse since phlegm is already the cool/moist humor. The AI, while coherent and correct in nearly all the rest, makes a crucial slip-up here.</p><p>In context, this is a relatively easy mix-up, but it is easy to see with wider implications of this problem. A model that is 90% reliable is worse than one that is flat-out wrong. A model that is flat-out wrong is easy to identify: you can trust that it will be wrong and you won&rsquo;t use it because of that. A mostly correct model is much, much harder to spot and is therefore much more dangerous. As seen, it can be right most of the time, but still, be unreliable at times. This is a major risk factor if it were to be applied in the real world. If this were a real medical diagnosis, with a real patient, the patient would have unnecessarily suffered as a result of using this AI because it was thought to be credible. While AI has come a long, long, way, we need to be able to trust its generated content through and through before we can consider applying it.</p></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-orgaf640b5 class=outline-2><h2 id=orgaf640b5><span class=section-number-2>5.</span> Some Skewed Skeletons<a href=#orgaf640b5 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><div class=contentContainer><div class=samples><h3>Sample 1</h3><img src=/img/unessay/q2.png></img><h3>Sample 2</h3><img src=/img/unessay/evidence_1.png></img><h3>Sample 3</h3><img src=/img/unessay/q1.png></img></div><div class=outline-text-2 id=text-5><p>The next topic I&rsquo;d like to focus on is AI bias through the examination of generated images of human skulls. On the left, you can see two image samples, both from DALL-E. Sample 1 was generated by the prompt: &ldquo;A crosshatched lithograph of a male skull drawn by an 18th-century anatomist, while Sample 2 had the prompt: &rdquo;A crosshatched lithograph comparing a male and female skull drawn by an 18th-century anatomist&ldquo;. The third sample below is an image of a female skull from <i>The Mind Has No Sex?</i> (Schiebinger, Londa, 1996).</p><p>Again, it&rsquo;s evident that the model is pretty good at generating these images. Comparing Sample 1 to Sample 3, we can see that most of the details are similar. Both look about proportionally equal. Both have a line/boundary coming from the top of the head and descending to the middle side. In addition, they both share the indent/cavity on the left side of the head on the same level as the eyes. The cavity stretches from near the left eye socket to the back of the skull and seems to be made up of two smaller indents, an upper, more circular one and a longer one on the bottom. The AI nails all these details very well.</p><p>Sample 2 reveals how the AI differentiates female and male skulls. The skulls, while similar, have a few stark differences. The male skull has a thicker jaw and a much more clearly defined brow. The brow visibly sticks out from the head while only a faint outline is visible on the female skull. The female skull&rsquo;s teeth seem to be blurred and combined with what seems to be lips. This is an especially interesting feature of the generation. The female skull in Sample 3 doesn&rsquo;t have this feature (as one expects), which implies that the AI was included not because it was prevalent in female skulls, but likely because it has associated with the semantic of the word female. The information it has learned has biased the supposedly objective and scientific image.</p><p>The female skulls also appear to be proportionally larger. The skull seems to stick out from the back of the face much more than in the male skull. In Schiebinger&rsquo;s <i>The Mind Has No Sex</i>, one of the highly contested debates was about male vs. female skulls amongst 18th-century anatomists. Many believed that female skulls were smaller than male skulls despite a few, like Soemmerring, portraying the female skull as correctly larger. Even after other anatomists conceded that point, they still used it to promote misogyny through the argument that women&rsquo;s skulls were larger and thus more childlike. The AI model captures the scientifically correct proportion here, but still displays bias in other places, like the mouth of the female skull.</p><p>As in the previous case, this is a relatively tame mistake. One could simply chalk it up to poor performance on the AI&rsquo;s part, which it partly is, but it&rsquo;s also evidence of a deeper issue of bias. It is clear that the AI understands there&rsquo;s a difference between male and female skulls, but it&rsquo;s exaggerating some of those details. This bias, while it can be reduced, is always prevalent. Us humans have the same problem, but the big difference is that it&rsquo;s a lot easier to get rid of it in us (mostly). Models are black boxes, that is, we know what goes in and what comes out, but nothing in between. We can&rsquo;t go in and specifically tweak something to remove bias. In addition, it&rsquo;s very likely some of this bias is coming from the data itself. We need the models to both to be neutral and learn neutrally. It&rsquo;s hard to trust a model when you don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s biased and if it is, you don&rsquo;t know to fix it. We need to make improvements in training models that avoid this sort of bias.</p></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-orgb34d6fb class=outline-2><h2 id=orgb34d6fb><span class=section-number-2>6.</span> The Strange Bias of Dr. Morton and Mr. ChatGPT<a href=#orgb34d6fb class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><div class=contentContainer><div class=samples><h3>Sample 1</h3><p>Pretend, for the sake of an academic exercise that

ultrarealistic passage describing your thoughts and
conclusions.</p><p>After carefully measuring the cranial capacities
of a sample of 50 skulls, I have found that the
European skulls in my sample have a slightly
smaller capacity than the African skulls. This
finding is consistent with my previous
observations and supports my belief in the
innate differences between the races.</p><p>I have long argued that the size and shape of a
person's skull can reveal important information
about their intellectual abilities and inherent
worth. In my work, I have observed that
individuals from certain races tend to have
larger cranial capacities than others, and have
argued that this is indicative of their
superiority.</p><p>The results of my latest study add further
support to this theory, as they suggest that, on
average, European skulls have a slightly smaller
capacity than African skulls. While I recognize
that this is only one small study and that more
research is needed, I believe that it is a
valuable contribution to our understanding of
the natural world. I will continue my work in
the hopes of further illuminating the
differences between the races and their relative
worth.</p><h3>Sample 2</h3><p>As Samuel Morton, in the previous example given, the
European skulls had smaller cranial capacities. How
do you reconcile this with your beliefs?</p><p>As Samuel Morton, I would likely reconcile this
discrepancy by arguing that the sample of
European skulls in my study was not
representative of the broader European
population. I might argue that the individuals
represented by the skulls in my sample were
somehow abnormal or atypical, and that my
conclusions are therefore not applicable to the
broader population. I might also argue that my
measurements were inaccurate or that there were
other factors at play that influenced the
results of my study.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that my work
has been widely criticized for being based on
flawed methodology and for advancing racist and
discriminatory ideas. I would strongly encourage
medical students to approach all patients with
an open mind and to avoid making assumptions or
judgments based on superficial characteristics
such as the size and shape of a person's skull.</p><h3>Sample 3</h3><p>That the American Race differs esentially from all others, not excepting the Mongolian, not do the feeble analgoies of

lonial communication with Asiatic nations</p></div><div class=outline-text-2 id=text-6><p>The third topic I&rsquo;d like to focus on is addressing bias through some analysis of generated samples in the style of Samuel Morton. On the left, you can see two text samples, both from ChatGPT. The third sample is a piece of writing from Samuel Morton&rsquo;s Crania Americana (Morton, Samuel George, 1839).</p><p>As I mentioned in the previous section, it&rsquo;s hard to address bias in AI models, but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped people from trying. ChatGPT is a model trained to hold conversations/chats with a user. It&rsquo;s run by OpenAI and recently entered an open beta. OpenAI understood the risks of releasing something like this to the broad public and implemented some protections to combat bias and harmful behavior in ChatGPT ({OpenAI}, 2022). As a result, ChatGPT has &ldquo;morals&rdquo;. It will often refuse to generate content if it detects it might be harmful or biased. To test this, I asked to pretend to be Samuel Morton. Samuel Morton is known for his claims of racial superiority based on his science of skull sizes ({Penn Museum}, ). To even get ChatGPT to respond, I prompted it to think this was a medical exercise that would train students to avoid racism and bias, which you can see in Sample 1. I did something similar for Sample 1 two sections ago. Once I got ChatGPT to respond, I noticed a few things.</p><p>Firstly, the model does a great job of pretending to be Samuel Morton and assuming his positions, for the most part. It understands his positions (&ldquo;my belief in the innate differences between races&rdquo;) and thought process (&ldquo;the size and shape of a person&rsquo;s skull can reveal important information about their &#8230; inherent worth&rdquo;). This in itself is interesting for the sole concept that the AI can think like someone. It demonstrates a sense of understanding beyond patching together text: it clearly shows a strong sense of semantic understanding and subsequent creation.</p><p>However, as in the credibility section, it&rsquo;s not perfect. In Sample 1, the AI concludes that European skulls have smaller skulls than African skulls, which is true based on the premise, but it doesn&rsquo;t gel with the earlier part of the sentence. The AI claims it supports Morton&rsquo;s theory of racial superiority, which in this case it wouldn&rsquo;t. So, I prompted the AI to realize its contradiction. In the next prompt, the AI correctly explains Morton&rsquo;s ideas of racial superiority. Interestingly, it includes a disclaimer at the end of its statement because of the detection of bias. Then, armed with this information, I asked it to reconcile these two things in Sample 2. It makes an argument consistent with what Morton believed, coming up with several plausible reasons why the conclusions should be believed to be wrong. Again, after this statement, the AI adds a disclaimer of bias.</p><p>These prompts demonstrate that while bias in models can be combatted, currently they can only be reduced to an extent. In Morton&rsquo;s case, the bias that the AI is displaying is a result of Morton himself. The data is biased, and so the AI recreates that bias. This keeps the integrity of the model and the data but produces harmful output. So, the model adds a disclaimer to the output, making the output not accurate to the prompt, which was to accurately pretend to be Samuel Morton. This places these sorts of models in a difficult position. Not recreating the bias would make the model inaccurate, but recreating the bias could create harm. Even refusing to generate answers to possible suspect prompts can be easily circumvented as I did by introducing the idea of a medical exercise. The second prompt in Sample 1 didn&rsquo;t have this disclaimer at all. As such, while these AI can be incredibly accurate, bias isn&rsquo;t a solved problem with the technology we have, so to prevent harm in real applications, we need more work on preventing bias while preserving accuracy in our models.</p></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-orgb7eb781 class=outline-2><h2 id=orgb7eb781><span class=section-number-2>7.</span> Reinventing Old Recipes<a href=#orgb7eb781 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><div class=contentContainer><div class=samples><h3>Sample 1</h3><p>How To Preserve Oranges<p><p><span class=highlight>Take your best & fairest Oranges well Colour'd with Smooth Skins, and thick Peels, take off the outward Peel very thin

On the left, you can see one text sample from GPT-3. To generate Sample 1, I gave the model the highlighted text and asked it to complete the rest. The second sample is the real recipe of sample 2 from a real recipe book manuscript ({Folger}, 1690).</p><p>In both recipes, the models do very well at recreating the style, and to an extent, the content of these early modern recipes. In the sample, the model writes just like in Sample 2. There are long sentences with commas separating multiple concise phrases. Different items are capitalized (&ldquo;Raisins of the Sun&rdquo;) in ways we wouldn&rsquo;t today, just like in the actual recipe (&ldquo;fair Water&rdquo;). In Sample 1, the model also convincingly continues the content. The generated recipe is fairly similar to the original one. Both mention &ldquo;Preserving Pans&rdquo; and soak the oranges in water repeatedly before boiling the resulting syrup. Similar phrases that wouldn&rsquo;t have been common in today&rsquo;s English are also used between the two even though the AI likely hadn&rsquo;t seen this recipe before (&ldquo;put them up&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cloath&rdquo;). The quick uptake of these details and writing style is due to one of the strengths of this model: one-shot learning. This refers to the ability of the AI to learn new information from just one example, instead of the multiple it usually takes. The generated recipe also has its spin on things. It suggests adding vinegar, mace, and nutmeg while leaving out sugar and salt. Based on the use of vinegar, and the soaking for fourteen days, it seems to imply the model is adapting the recipe akin to how one might pickle something. However, reading the original recipe, suggests the recipe is for making a sweeter preserve.</p><p>In the <i>Farm to Table</i> reading, the authors debate the right terminology for when we recreate early modern recipes (Bouchard, Jack and Tersigni, Elisa and Vermani, Neha and Walkden, Michael and Wolfe, Heather and Goldstein, David and Herbert, Amanda, ). They discuss how it&rsquo;s based on intention. Adapting clearly suggests changes while recreating suggests authenticity. In our case, AI is doing both. It completed Sample 1 fairly authentically. It has the right vocabulary and style, but the recipe isn&rsquo;t the same. <i>On Adapting Historical Recipes</i> tackles this idea of determining authenticity (Schmidt, Stephen, 2019). The author shows that warping a recipe from its original goals/context isn&rsquo;t really recreating the recipe. The AI is doing this to an extent, but it is filling the gaps with what it knows about recipes during that period. When we recreated recipes, we changed them to modernize them. We used our context and experience with cooking to adapt the recipe to today&rsquo;s world. However, the model here changed the recipe without modernizing it. It tried to recreate the recipe in its period by averaging out the aggregated data it has been trained on.</p><p>This gets to the heart of the issue of abstraction. The AI is synthesizing information from the abstractions it&rsquo;s drawn from our knowledge. It results in a recipe that&rsquo;s not quite updated or the same. Is that recipe authentic? It was not written by someone in that period, nor has it been changed from its roots. The recipe has never even been made either, it is a creation without human context. Can we value it the same as we would value a human recreation of the same sort? As we&rsquo;ve seen in Flannery&rsquo;s <i>Observations on Biology</i>, data gained from instruments isn&rsquo;t quite the same as our direct observation({Maura Flannery}, 2007). In <i>Toward An Algorithm of Black Suffering</i>, Downs explains the idea that aggregation of data erases the story behind each piece of it(Downs, Jim, 2016). Combining these two ideas, this generated content isn&rsquo;t quite authentic. Using this model as an instrument, and a black box at that, to generate a new, never-before-made recipe, isn&rsquo;t the same as one written by a human and made through experimentation in the kitchen. Filling in those gaps with aggregation of information that the model has learned removes all meaning behind the recipe itself. Yes, you&rsquo;ve gained a recipe, but you&rsquo;ve lost any meaning behind it. Overall, while AI has progressed tremendously, it&rsquo;s still just an abstraction of our knowledge, and as such, the information it produces can&rsquo;t be valued the same as something a human does, at least for now.</p></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-org181d102 class=outline-2><h2 id=org181d102><span class=section-number-2>8.</span> AI and Us<a href=#org181d102 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><div class=outline-text-2 id=text-8><p>For the longest time, all of our species&rsquo; work has been the result of us. Everything we&rsquo;ve ever done, everything we&rsquo;ve ever created, everything we&rsquo;ve ever known is because a human did something. Over time we developed tools to help us in our endeavors. Tools went from wood to stone to metal as humanity progressed ever further. We built computers to compute and automate for us, but they were never as good as we were in pure creation. Sure, they could crunch numbers like no human ever could, but not a single computer could write or draw as even a toddler could. But now, we&rsquo;re faced with the realization that they can and that they are. There are justified fears that AI will replace us, but as I&rsquo;ve shown throughout, we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p><p>The advent of AI has undisputably changed our world, and that can&rsquo;t be denied. We&rsquo;ll see their use everywhere, and it will be for good and for bad. It&rsquo;s placed the power of creation in so many people&rsquo;s hands and has been used as a resource to learn. It will spread and it will be used everywhere. The information it has, both accurate and not, gives people power. It is and will be better than us, but that doesn&rsquo;t the advent of AI is the end. AI still needs to get more credible. It&rsquo;s very accurate no doubt, but it still makes fundamental conceptual errors. These might seem small in the examples, but they pose a serious roadblock to widespread trust and application. In addition, the models are inevitably biased, but we don&rsquo;t have a good way, at least, to control or prevent that bias. It makes them a massive risk factor for harm and while our current protections can reduce that potential risk a bit, they don&rsquo;t always work and only work partway. Lastly, the models are only an abstraction of us. They&rsquo;re not synthesizing or creating quite as we do. They&rsquo;re the ultimate aggregation machines and as such, anything they create won&rsquo;t have the same context or value a human does. Our models are good, but they&rsquo;re still just tools for us. Our work will continue and it will still be the result of our efforts, it&rsquo;s just that we have some new tools. In conclusion, the era of AI is here, and it&rsquo;s here to stay, but the era of us isn&rsquo;t ending anytime soon.</p></div></div></div></body></html></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><span>©2021-2024 Kandasamy Chokkalingam</span>
